# Screen Time and Well-Being Analysis

## Project Description

This project focuses on investigating the relationship between screen time and overall well-being. As screen time increases globally, understanding its impact on physical and mental health becomes crucial.

## Project Goals

- Analyze patterns of screen time usage.
- Determine the effects of extended screen time on sleep, physical activity, and mental health.
- Provide actionable recommendations for maintaining a healthy balance between screen time and well-being.

## Repository Structure

- **ANALYSIS/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with data analysis.
- **time_wasters/**: Includes scripts for identifying apps and websites that consume significant time without substantial benefits.
- **Dashboard1.twb**: Tableau dashboard file for visualizing analysis results.
- **Final Project.pptx**: Presentation summarizing the project's outcomes and key findings.
- **datasets_summary.xlsx**: Spreadsheet summarizing the datasets used.
- **first_chek.txt**: Text file with initial observations and notes.

## Required Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetic data visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Scipy.stats**: For statistical analysis.
- **Tableau (desktop tool)**: For building interactive dashboards (not a Python library but essential for the project).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and organizing analysis code.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ValentinaBogdanova/Screen_Time_and_Well_being_analysis.git


   Install the required Python libraries:

```bash

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scipy jupyter

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the ANALYSIS folder to reproduce and review the analysis.

3. Use the Dashboard1.twb file in Tableau for interactive visualization.

Conclusion
Understanding the impact of screen time on well-being is a vital step toward improving the quality of life. This project provides 
tools and insights to help users adopt a mindful approach to digital device usage and maintain a healthy balance in everyday life.
